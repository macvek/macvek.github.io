<h3>Why to get into vim?</h3>
<p>
I have a mixed felling about vim. In my regular work I use neovim. After few weeks I got into all (I guess) relevant keybindings and I can say - it works for me.</p>

<p>
There is a BUT here. The BUT is about how horrible, for me, is extending this editor. The biggest struggles I find, as a software developer, is to 'feel' where to place new stuff if I want to extends something,
and where should it be in the first place, once I want to modify it. With vim/neovim it gives me creeps. I feel lost every time I want to alter any settings.</p>
<p>
My setup is <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a> + <a href="https://nvchad.com/">nvchad</a>, which just works for most cases. While finding configs in cloned plugin repository, I managed to turn on LSP support and it all so so works. BUT still I'm not confident enough to figure how it all works together.</p>

<p>
Experience with Visual Studio Code gave me mixed feelings (mainly due to performance of the editor itself), still it always had this single <i>extensions</i> tab accessible to browse what is installed.
The extension management is really super easy in comparison to what I get for vim. So the goal is to figure out how all these plugins and extensions work and combine together.</p>

<p>
I figured that as it already works for me for 95%, I should get into a source code and try to understand concepts behind how vim/neovim is designed and try to solve the mistery of where stuff should be,
in order to modify it / add something or disable something without breaking the whole setup.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
First things first. To get started into source code, it must be pulled from somewhere. 
Vim is hosted on github: <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim.git">https://github.com/vim/vim.git</a>.

<p>
Before getting into source code, there are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vim.org">https://www.vim.org</a> - an official vim website </li>
<li><a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_toc.html">https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_toc.html</a> - here jump down to 'Tuning Vim' section for vim-script tutorial.</li>
</ul>
